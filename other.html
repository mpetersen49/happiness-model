  <p>The World Happiness Report evaluates six key variables, which examines different aspects of life. The six factors are GDP per capita, healthy years of life expectancy, social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble), trust (as measured by a perceived absence of corruption in government and business), perceived freedom to make life decisions, and generosity (as measured by recent donations, adjusted for differences in income). GDP has the highest degree of correlation of happiness with a correlation coefficient of .789, followed by health with a correlation coefficient of .742. The lowest degree of correlation is generosity with a correlation coefficient of .138. The overall average score of World Happiness from 2015-2019 is 5.377. </p>

  <p>Interpreting the Pearson Correlation:
    As you move along the X-axis you can choose a variable and see how each variable relates to the other six key variables; most importantly how each of the six key variables impacts a country’s overall happiness score. A high degree of correlation is a value between ± 0.50 and ± 1, a moderate degree is a value between ± 0.30 and ± 0.49 and a low degree of correlation is + .29. No correlation is defined by a correlation coefficient of 0 and a perfect correlation is a correlation coefficient of 1. A negative, or inverse correlation occurs when the correlation coefficient is less than 0. This is an indication that both variables move in the opposite direction. 
    For example, when examining the impact of social support on the country’s overall happiness score, the Pearson Correlation Chart shows us the score is 0.65. A correlation coefficient of 0.65 is interpreted as a high degree of correlation. In further terms, how an individual views their social support system within a country has a high degree of correlation in that country’s overall happiness score.</p>
